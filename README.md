#### a PYthon library for COntract-based design -- lite edition


This library provides a simple set of primitives to manipulate
*Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)-based Assume/Guarantee (A/G)contracts*.
It allows the definition of new contracts, compute compositions, and check for refinement, consistency,
and compatibility.

This library is used as a building block for a larger project:
[PyCo](https://github.com/ianno/pyco).

## Prerequisites
To use this library, you need to have [nuXmv](https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/) installed on your system.

## Getting Started
This project can be installed as a python package,
and can be used by importing it in your python source files.

### Installing
To install the library, go to the root folder of the project and
modify setup.cfg to match your configuration.
Then, from a command line, run

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This last command will install all the required python dependencies.

### Testing
To make sure the installation has been successful,
you can run some tests by running from a command line,
always in the project root folder:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
After executing the last command, you should get a message saying that all the tests were passed.
