'''
This module includes the definition of abstract classes to be used in
interfacing with external tools.
The strategy pattern is implemented to allow easy swap between different tools.

class RefinementStrategy:

    Metaclass defining the refinement strategy operations

        '''
        Checks if refining_contract refines abstract_contract.
        A contract C1 refines a contract C2 if the assumptions of C2 are
        included in C1 assumptions and if C1 guaratees are included in C2
        guarantees

    @abstractmethod
    def check_compatibility(self):
        '''
        Checks if the calling Contract object is compatible.
        A contract is compatible iff there exists at least one environment
        in which it can operate, that is, the assumption formula must not
        be empty

class ConsistencyStrategy:

    Metaclass defining the consistency check set of operations
    '''

    __metaclass__ = ABCMeta

    @abstractmethod
    def check_consistency(self):
        '''
        Checks if the calling Contract object is consistent.
        A contract is consistent iff it is not self-contradicting. In case of a
        self-contradicting contract, it is impossible to find an implementation
        that satisfies it. Thus to verify consistency, we need to check that the
        guarantee formula is not an empty formula
